## Natural Language processsor
NLP is a program providing two main queries in a large dataset : 
1. Given a word in the dataset, find the most probable word that comes after
him.
2. given a word in dataset, suggest the most interesting file to look into.

This API was implemented using the help of a text processing library called 
NLPcore.
